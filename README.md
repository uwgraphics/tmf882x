# TMF882X Package for ROS 2

This package is for interfacing with the AMS TMF882X family of sensors over ROS 2. It includes a node for publishing readings from the sensor (connected to an Arduino, which is connected to the computer running ROS), and for visualizing data from the sensor using matplotlib.
